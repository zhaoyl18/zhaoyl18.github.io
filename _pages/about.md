I am Yulai, a second-year Ph.D. student at Princeton working on machine learning. My departmental page is [here](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/yulai-zhao).

My research interests lie in theories/experiments of modern machine learning. I am also eager to investigate the infinite potential of modern data-driven approaches in practice.
