I am Yulai, a Ph.D. student focusing on machine learning. I am fortunate to be co-advised by Professor [Jason D. Lee](https://jasondlee88.github.io/) and Professor [S. Y. Kung](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/sun-yuan-kung). Departmental page can be found [here](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/yulai-zhao).

My research interests lie in theories/experiments of modern machine learning. I am also eager to investigate the infinite potential of modern data-driven approaches in practice.
