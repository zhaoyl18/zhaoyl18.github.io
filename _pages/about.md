<!-- I'm Yulai, a Ph.D. student at Princeton. I'm fortunately advised by Professor [S.Y. Kung](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/sun-yuan-kung) and [Jason D. Lee](https://jasondlee88.github.io/). My research interests lie in theories/experiments of modern machine learning. I am also eager to investigate the infinite potential of modern data-driven approaches in practice. -->
