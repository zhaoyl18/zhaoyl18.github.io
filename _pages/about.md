I am Yulai, a second-year Ph.D. student at Princeton working on machine learning.  
<!-- For more details about my academic background, please visit my [[departmental page]](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/yulai-zhao).   -->

My research primarily explores the theories and practical applications of modern machine learning. I am particularly fascinated by the vast possibilities that data-driven approaches can unlock in various fields.

## Experiences

- Ph.D. Student @ Electrical and Computer Engineering, Princeton University
- Visiting Student @ Institute for Machine Learning, ETH ZÃ¼rich
- Research Assistant @ Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington
- Bachelor @ Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University
